# 🏥 Medical Image Generation with GANs  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
The tasks involved in this project explored **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate synthetic **medical images** like X-rays and MRIs. 🏥 You'll build a **custom GAN** from scratch and also use a **pre-trained GAN** to create realistic images. 🎨 
To make it interactive, you'll develop a **Streamlit web app** that allows users to generate medical images dynamically. 🌐 You'll also use **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration. 🗂️  

**Key Components**:

1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
   - A custom GAN was designed and trained to generate realistic medical images.
   - A pre-trained GAN was employed to enhance efficiency in the creation of synthetic datasets.

2. **Synthetic Data Utilization**:
   - Realistic medical images, including X-rays and MRIs, were generated using the GAN.
   - These synthetic images were utilized to train and evaluate machine learning models.

3. **Web App Development**:
   - An interactive web application was created using Streamlit, providing users with the ability to generate and visualize medical images.

4. **Version Control and Collaboration**:
   - Code changes were tracked using Git, and the project was shared through GitHub repositories to ensure collaborative development and proper version control.

**Skills and Knowledge Gained**:

- 🤖 **How to build and train a GAN from scratch**  
- 🖼️ **How to generate images using a pre-trained GAN**  
- 🏥 **How to train models with synthetic medical data**  
- 🌐 **How to build a web app using Streamlit**  
- 🗂️ **How to track and share code with Git & GitHub**

This project is a great way to explore **AI in healthcare** and build hands-on experience with GANs! 🚀✨
